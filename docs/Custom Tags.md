# Custom Tags

Lexicon offers fully customizable tagging to organize your library exactly the way you want. Here’s how to work with custom tags and categories, step by step.

---

## What Are Custom Tags?

Custom tags let you label your tracks with anything you need, such as `Techno`, `Has Vocals`, or any other criteria you care about. When searching for specific tracks, simply select the matching tags—Lexicon will instantly filter to show you what you’re looking for.

## Categories

Tags are grouped into categories (like _Mood_, _Genre_, or anything else you define).

- **Add a category:** Click `Add category` on the Tags page.
- **Edit a category:** Click the gear icon next to a category.
- **Set a color:** Assign a color for quick visual recognition.
- **Reorder categories:** Drag to rearrange them as needed.

---

## Creating and Managing Tags

- **Add a tag:** Click the `+` (plus) icon on a category panel.
- **Rename a tag:** Double-click the tag.
- **Delete a tag:** Right-click the tag (removes it from all tracks).
- **Move tags between categories:** Drag them to your preferred category.

## Adding Tags to Tracks

There are two main ways to add tags:

1. **Tags Column in Track Browser**
   - Show the Tags column.
   - Click an empty tag to open the tag popup and select tags.

2. **Track Recipes (Bulk Editing)**
   - Select multiple tracks, right-click, and choose `Edit`.
   - Go to the Recipes tab to add, remove, or replace tags for all selected tracks.

## Searching by Tags

You can search with tags in several ways:

- **Quickly filter:** Use the Track Browser filters at the top (see the Track Browser page for details).
- **Advanced search:** Create smartlists with rules to match tags.
- **Tags page:** Go to the Custom Tags page, select tags, and view results instantly.

---

## Importing Tags

- **Rekordbox 6/7 Users:** Your MyTags are imported automatically when you bring your library into Lexicon.
- **From Text (Hashtag System):** If your comments contain tags like `#Techno #Vocals`, you can import them:
  - Select tracks, right-click, and choose `Edit`.
  - Switch to Recipes and select "Import tags from text."
  - New tags appear in the _Imported Tags_ category (drag them into other categories as needed).

---

## Exporting Tags

- **Sync to DJ Apps:** Use Field Mapping on the Sync page.
  - Set "All Custom Tags" as the source.
  - Set the target to `Comment` (or another field).
  - Lexicon exports tags in hashtag format (e.g., `#Techno #Vocals`) per track.

- **Export Specific Categories:** You can select a single category as the export source to include only those tags.
- **Rekordbox Limitation:** Only 4 MyTag categories are supported (see Rekordbox documentation for details).

---

## Finding Tracks by Tags

On the Custom Tags page:

- Select one or more tags (hold `Cmd/Ctrl` or `Shift` to multi-select).
- Click `Show tracks` to view all matching tracks.

**How tag search works:**

- Within the same category: all selected tags are treated as **OR** (e.g., "Techno" _or_ "Drum & Bass").
- Across different categories: tags are combined by **AND** (e.g., [Genre: "Techno" or "Drum & Bass"] **AND** [Vocals: "No Vocals"]).

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Open tag popup:** Press `T`.
- **Navigate tag popup:** Use `Arrow Up`/`Down` to move, type to filter, `Enter` to add/remove a tag, and `Esc` to save and close.
- **Assign keys to tags:** Right-click a tag in the Custom Tags page to assign it a number. Create your own shortcuts for these numbers in Lexicon’s settings.
